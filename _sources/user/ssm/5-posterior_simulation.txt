Posterior Simulation
--------------------

State space models are also amenable to parameter estimation by Bayesian
methods. We consider posterior simulation by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods, and in particular using the Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling
algorithms. This section describes how to use the above models in Bayesian
estimation, but fortunately no further modifications need be made. Classes
defined as in the maximum likelihood section (i.e. classes that extend from
``dp.ssm.MLEModel``) can be used for either maximum likelihood estimation
or Bayesian estimation. Thus the example code is only tasked with *applying*
the previously defined state space models.

A full discussion of Bayesian techniques is beyond the scope of this paper, but
interested readers can consult :cite:`koop_bayesian_2003` for a general
introduction to Bayesian econometrics, :cite:`west_bayesian_1999` for a
comprehensive Bayesian approach to state space models, and
:cite:`kim_state-space_1999` for a excellent practical text on parameter
estimation in state space models. The following introduction to Bayesian
methods is drawn from these references.

The Bayesian approach to parameter estimation begins by considering parameters
as random variables. Bayes' theorem is applied to derive a distribution for the
parameters conditional on the observed data. This "posterior" distribution is
proportional to the likelihood function multiplied by a "prior" distribution
for the parameters. The prior summarizes all information the researcher has on
the parameter values prior to observing the data. Denoting the prior as
:math:`\pi(\psi)`, the likelihood function as
:math:`\mathcal{L}(Y_n \mid \psi)`, and the posterior as
:math:`\pi(\psi \mid Y_n)`, we have

.. math::

    \pi(\psi \mid Y_n) \propto \mathcal{L}(Y_n \mid \psi) \pi(\psi)

The posterior distribution is the quantity of interest; the difficulty of
working with it depends on the prior specified by the researcher and the
likelihood function entailed by the selected model. In specific cases (for
example the special case of "conjugate priors") the analytic form of the
posterior distribution can be found and used for analysis directly. More often
the posterior is not available analytically so other methods must be used to
explore its properties.

Posterior simulation is a method available when a procedure exists to *sample*
from the posterior distribution even though the analytic form of the
distribution may not be known. Posterior simulation considers drawing samples
:math:`\psi_s, s=1 \dots S`. Under fairly weak conditions a law of large
numbers can be applied so that, given the :math:`S` samples, sample averages
can be used to approximate population quantities:

.. math::

    \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^S g(\psi_s) \to \int g(\psi) \pi(\psi \mid Y_n) d \psi = E_{\pi(\cdot \mid Y_n)} \left [ g(\psi) \right ]

For example, the posterior mean is often of interest and corresponds to
:math:`g(\psi) = \psi`. Histograms can be used to examine the shapes of the
marginal distributions of individual parameters.

It may seem that sampling from an unknown distribution is impossible, but MCMC
methods allow the *eventual* sampling from an unknown distribution by applying
an algorithm designed to ensure that the unknown distribution is an invariant
distribution of a Markov chain. The Markov chain is initialized with an
arbitrary value, and then a transition density, denoted
:math:`f(\psi_s \mid \psi_{s-1})`, is applied to draw subsequent values
conditional only on the previous value. The appropriate selection of the
transition densities can usually ensure that there exists some value
:math:`\hat s` such that every subsequently drawn sample
:math:`\psi_s, ~ s > \hat s` is marginally distributed according to the unknown
distribution of interest. [#]_  The two methods discussed below differ
in the specification of the transition density.

Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Metropolis-Hastings algorithm** [#]_

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a very general strategy for constructing
a Markov chain with the desired invariant distribution. The transition density
is specified in the following way:

1. Given the current value of the chain, :math:`\psi_{s-1}`, a proposal value,
   :math:`\psi^*`, is selected according to a proposal
   :math:`q(\psi ; \psi_{s-1})` which is a fixed density function for a given
   value :math:`\psi_{s-1}`.
2. With probability :math:`\alpha(\psi_{s-1}, \psi^*)` (defined below) the
   proposed value is accepted so that the next value of the chain is set to
   :math:`\psi_s = \psi^*`; if it is not accepted, the chain remains in place
   :math:`\psi_s = \psi_{s-1}`.

   .. math::

        \alpha(\psi_{s-1}, \psi^*) = \min \left \{ \frac{\pi(\psi^* \mid Y_n) q(\psi^* ; \psi_{s-1})}{\pi(\psi_{s-1} \mid Y_n) q(\psi_{s-1} ; \psi^*)}, 1 \right \}

Practically speaking, the important component of this algorithm is that only
the ratio of posterior quantities is required. Recalling from above that the
posterior is proportional to the likelihood and the prior we can rewrite the
probability of acceptance as:

.. math::

    \alpha(\psi_{s-1}, \psi^*) = \min \left \{ \frac{\mathcal{L}(Y_n \mid \psi^*) \pi(\psi^*) q(\psi^* ; \psi_{s-1})}{\mathcal{L}(Y_n \mid \psi_{s-1}) \pi(\psi_{s-1}) q(\psi_{s-1} ; \psi^*)}, 1 \right \}

Given a particular specification for the prior and proposal distributions,
*this ratio can be computed* where the likelihood function is evaluated as a
byproduct of the Kalman filter iterations. In the special case that the
proposal distribution satistifes
:math:`q(\psi_{s-1} ; \psi^*) = q(\psi^* ; \psi_{s-1})` (as will be the case in
the examples below), we can again rewrite the probabilty of acceptance as

.. math::
    :label: accept_prob

    \alpha(\psi_{s-1}, \psi^*) = \min \left \{ \frac{\mathcal{L}(Y_n \mid \psi^*) \pi(\psi^*)}{\mathcal{L}(Y_n \mid \psi_{s-1}) \pi(\psi_{s-1})}, 1 \right \}

One convenient choice of proposal distrubtion that allows this is the so-called
random walk proposal with Gaussian increment, defined such that

.. math::
    :label: rw_proposal

    \psi^* = \psi_{s-1} + \epsilon_s, \qquad \epsilon_s \sim N(0, \Sigma_\epsilon)

Notice that to use this proposal distribution, we must set the variance
:math:`\Sigma_\epsilon`. This is often calibrated to achieve some target
acceptance rate (ratio of accepted to rejected draws); see the references above
for more details.

**Gibbs sampling algorithm**

Suppose that we can block the parameter vector into :math:`K` subvectors, so
that :math:`\psi = \{\psi^{(1)}, \psi^{(2)}, \dots, \psi^{(K)}\}`, and further
suppose that all *conditional* posterior distributions of the form
:math:`\pi(\psi^{(k)} \mid \psi^{(-k)}, Y_n), ~ k=1, \dots, K` can be sampled
from. Then the transition density moving from :math:`\psi_{s-1}` to
:math:`\psi_s` can be defined as follows:

1. Given the current value of the chain :math:`\psi_{s-1}`, sample
   :math:`\psi_{s}^{(1)}` according to the density
   :math:`\pi(\psi^{(1)} \mid \psi_{s-1}^{(-1)}, Y_n)`.
2. Sample :math:`\psi_{s}^{(2)}` according to the density
   :math:`\pi(\psi^{(1)} \mid \psi_{s-1}^{(-1,2)}, \psi_{s}^{(1)}, Y_n)`
3. [repeat for :math:`k=3, \dots, K`]
4. Then :math:`\psi_s = \{ \psi_s^{(1)}, \psi_s^{(2)}, \dots, \psi_s^{(K)} \}`

In the case of state space models, we can augment the parameter vector to
include the unobserved states. Notice then that the conditional posterior
distribution for the states is exactly the distribution from which the
simulation smoother produces simulated states; i.e. :math:`\tilde \alpha` is
drawn according to :math:`\pi(\alpha \mid \psi, Y_n)`.

The conditional distributions for the parameter vector must be identified on a
case-by-case basis. However, notice that the conditional posterior distribution
conditions on the unobserved states, so that in many cases the conditional
distributions follow from well known econometric problems. For example, if the
observation covariance matrix is diagonal, the parameters in the observation
equation can be viewed as equation-by-equation OLS.

**Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling algorithm**

In the case that the parameter vector can be blocked as above but some of the
conditional posterior distributions cannot be directly sampled from, a hybrid
MCMC approach can be taken. The Gibbs sampling algorithm is used as defined
above, except that for any block :math:`k` such that the conditional posterior
cannot be sampled from, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is applied for that
block (i.e. a proposal is generated for that block of parameters and it is
accepted with the probability defined above).

.. [#] Of course the value :math:`\hat s` is unknown and can in some cases be
       quite large, although statistical tests do exist that can explore this
       issue.

.. [#] This discussion is somewhat loose; see :cite:`tierney_markov_1994` and
       :cite:`chib_understanding_1995` for careful treatments.

Implementing Metropolis-Hastings: the local level model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section we describe implementing the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to
estimation unknown parameters of a state space model. First, it is illuminating
to consider a direct approach where all code is explicit; second, we consider
using the another Python library to streamline the estimation process.

Recalling the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, above, in order to proceed we will
need to evaluate the likelihood and the prior and specify a proposal
distribution. The likelihood will be evaluated using the Kalman filter via the
``loglike`` method introduced earlier. The local level, as written above, has
two variance parameters :math:`\sigma_\varepsilon^2` and :math:`\sigma_\eta^2`.
In practice we will sample the standard deviations :math:`\sigma_\varepsilon`
and :math:`\sigma_\eta`. These parameters are chosen to have independent
inverse Gamma priors, with the shape and scale parameters set as in
:numref:`table-llevel-priors`. [#]_ We will use the random walk proposal,
which simply requires drawing a value from a multivariate normal distribution
each iteration. We set the variance of the random walk innovation to be the
identity matrix times ten. The prior distributions can be evaluated and variates
drawn from the multivariate normal using the Python package SciPy. 

.. _table-llevel-priors:

.. table:: Priors for the local level model applied to Nile data.

    +----------------------------+---------------------+--------+--------+-------------+-----------------+
    | Parameter                  | Prior distribution  | Shape  | Scale  | Prior mean  | Prior variance  |
    +============================+=====================+========+========+=============+=================+
    | :math:`\sigma_\varepsilon` | Inverse-gamma       | 3      | 300    | 150         | 22,500          |
    +----------------------------+---------------------+--------+--------+-------------+-----------------+
    | :math:`\sigma_\eta`        | Inverse-gamma       | 3      | 120    | 60          | 3,600           |
    +----------------------------+---------------------+--------+--------+-------------+-----------------+


For each iteration, the acceptance probability can be calculated from the above
elements, and the decision to accept or reject can be made by comparing the
acceptance probability to a random variate from a standard uniform
distribution.

.. [#] To be clear, since there are multiple ways to parameterize the
       inverse-gamma distribution, with :math:`x \sim \text{IG}(\alpha, \beta)`
       the density we consider is

       .. math::

            p(x) = \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{-\alpha - 1} e^{-\frac{\beta}{x}}

Direct approach
"""""""""""""""

Given the existence of the local level class (``MLELocalLevel``) for
calculating the loglikelihood, the code for performing MCMC exercise is
relatively simple. First, we initialize the priors and the proposal
distribution:

::

    from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal, invgamma, uniform

    # Create the model for likelihood evaluation
    model = MLELocalLevel(nile)

    # Specify priors
    prior_obs = invgamma(3, scale=300)
    prior_level = invgamma(3, scale=120)

    # Specify the random walk proposal
    rw_proposal = multivariate_normal(cov=np.eye(2)*10)

Next, we perform 10,000 Metropolis-Hastings iterations as follows. The
resultant histograms and traces in terms of the variances, as well as a plot of
the acceptance ratio over the iterations, are given in
:numref:`figure_5-llevel-posteriors`. [#]_

::

    # Create storage arrays for the traces
    n_iterations = 10000
    trace = np.zeros((n_iterations + 1, 2))
    trace_accepts = np.zeros(n_iterations)
    trace[0] = [120, 30]  # Initial values

    # Iterations
    for s in range(1, n_iterations + 1):
        proposed = trace[s-1] + rw_proposal.rvs()

        acceptance_probability = np.exp(
            model.loglike(proposed**2) - model.loglike(trace[s-1]**2) +
            prior_obs.logpdf(proposed[0]) + prior_level.logpdf(proposed[1]) -
            prior_obs.logpdf(trace[s-1, 0]) - prior_level.logpdf(trace[s-1, 1]))

        if acceptance_probability > uniform.rvs():
            trace[s] = proposed
            trace_accepts[s-1] = 1
        else:
            trace[s] = trace[s-1]

.. _figure_5-llevel-posteriors:

.. figure:: images/fig_5-llevel-posteriors.png

.. [#] The output figures are ultimately based on 900 simulated values for each
       parameter. Of the 10,000 simulations performed, the first 1,000 were
       eliminated as the burn-in period, and the remaining 9,000 were thinned
       by only taking each 10th sample, to reduce the effects of autocorrelated
       draws.

Integration with PyMC
"""""""""""""""""""""

This can also be simply estimated by taking advantage of the PyMC library
(:cite:`patil_pymc:_2010`). A full discussion of the features and
use of this library is beyond the scope of this paper and instead we only
introduce the features we need for estimation of this model. A similar approach
would handle most state space models, and the PyMC documentation can be
consulted for more advanced usage, including sophisticated sampling techniques
such as slice sampling and No-U-Turn sampling.

As above, we need to create objects representing the selected priors and an
object representing the likelihood function. The former are referred to by
PyMC as "stochastic" elements, and the latter as a "data" element (which is
a stochastic element that has already been "observed", and so is not sampled
from). The priors and likelihood function using the ``MLELocalLevel`` class
defined above can be implemented with PyMC in the following way:

::

    import pymc as mc

    # Priors as "stochastic" elements
    prior_obs = mc.InverseGamma('obs', 3, 300)
    prior_level = mc.InverseGamma('level', 3, 120)

    # Create the model for likelihood evaluation
    model = MLELocalLevel(nile)

    # Create the "data" component (stochastic and observed)
    @mc.stochastic(dtype=dp.ssm.MLEModel, observed=True)
    def loglikelihood(value=model, obs_std=prior_obs, level_std=prior_level):
        return value.loglike([obs_std**2, level_std**2])

We do not need to explicitly specify the proposal; PyMC uses an adaptive
proposal by default. Instead, we simply need to create a "model", which unifies
the priors and likelihood, and a "sampler". The sampler is an object used to
perform the simulations and return the trace objects. The resultant histograms
and traces in terms of the variances from 10,000 iterations are given in
:numref:`figure_5-pymc-posteriors`. [#]_

::

    # Create the PyMC model
    pymc_model = mc.Model((prior_obs, prior_level, loglikelihood))

    # Create a PyMC sample and perform sampling
    sampler = mc.MCMC(pymc_model)
    sampler.sample(iter=10000, burn=1000, thin=10)

.. _figure_5-pymc-posteriors:

   the PyMC library.

       is used.

Implementing Gibbs sampling: the ARMA(1,1) model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section we describe implementing the Gibbs sampling algorithm to
estimation unknown parameters of a state space model. Since PyMC only has
preliminary support for Gibbs sampling, only the direct approach is presented
here. The Metropolis-within-Gibbs approach is used to demonstrate both how to
apply Gibbs sampling and how to apply a hybrid approach.

Recalling the Gibbs sampling algorithm, above, in order to proceed we need to
block the parameters and the unobserved states such the the conditional
distributions can be found. We will choose four blocks, so that the unobserved
states are in the first block, the moving average coefficient is in the second
block, and the two autoregressive coefficients and variance are in the last
block. In notation, this means that
:math:`\psi = \{ \psi^{(1)}, \psi^{(2)}, \psi^{(3)}, \psi^{(4)} \}` where
:math:`\psi^{(1)} = \alpha`, :math:`\psi^{(2)} = \phi`,
:math:`\psi^{(4)} = \sigma^2`, and :math:`\psi^{(4)} = \theta`,.
We will apply Gibbs steps for the first, third, and fourth blocks, and a
Metropolis step for the second block.

We select priors for the parameters so that the conditional posterior
distributions that we require can be constructed. For the autogressive
coefficients, we select a multivariate normal distribution - conditional on the
variance - with an identity covariance matrix restricted to the space such that
the corresponding lag polynomial is invertible. To be precise, the prior
is :math:`\phi \mid \sigma^2 \sim N(0, I)`.

For the variance, we select an inverse-gamma distribution - conditional on the
autoregressive coefficients - with the shape and scale parameters both set to
two. To be precise, the prior is
:math:`\sigma^2 \mid \phi \sim IG(3, 3)`. These choices will be
convenient due to their status as conjugate priors for the linear regression
model; they will lead to known conditional posterior distributions.

Finally, the prior for the moving-average coefficient is specified to be
uniform over the interval :math:`(-1, 1)`, so that
:math:`\theta \sim \text{unif}(-1, 1)`. Notice that the prior density for all
values in the range is equal, and so the acceptance probability is either zero,
in the case that the proposed value is outside the range, or else simplifies to
the ratio of the likelihoods because the prior values cancel out. We will use a
random walk proposal with standard normal increment.

Now, conditional on the model parameters, a draw of :math:`\psi^{(1)}` can be
taken by applying the simulation smoother, as shown in previous sections.
Next, notice that, given the values of the states, the first row of the
transition equation in :eq:`arma11` is simply a linear regression:

.. math::

    \alpha_{1,t+1} = \phi \alpha_{1,t} + \varepsilon_{t+1}

Stacking into matrix form yields :math:`Z = X \phi + \varepsilon`.
A standard result applying conjugate priors to the linear regression model (see
for example :cite:`kim_state-space_1999`) is that the conditional posterior
distribution for the coefficients is Gaussian and the conditional posterior
distribution for the variance is inverse-gamma. To be precise, given our choice
of prior hyperparameters here we have

.. math::

    \phi & \mid \sigma^2, \alpha, Y_n \sim N \Big( (\sigma^2 I + X' X)^{-1} X' Z, (I + \sigma^{-2} X' X)^{-1} \Big ) \\
    \sigma^2 & \mid \phi, \alpha, Y_n \sim IG \Big (3 + n, 3 + (Z - X \phi)'(Z - X \phi) \Big )

Making draws from these conditional posteriors can be implemented in the
following way:

::

    from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal, invgamma

    def draw_posterior_phi(model, states, sigma2):
        Z = states[0:1, 1:]
        X = states[0:1, :-1]
        
        tmp = np.linalg.inv(sigma2 * np.eye(1) + np.dot(X, X.T))
        post_mean = np.dot(tmp, np.dot(X, Z.T))
        post_var = tmp * sigma2
        
        return multivariate_normal(post_mean, post_var).rvs()

    def draw_posterior_sigma2(model, states, phi):
        resid = states[0, 1:] - phi * states[0, :-1]
        post_shape = 3 + model.nobs
        post_scale = 3 + np.sum(resid**2)

        return invgamma(post_shape, scale=post_scale).rvs()

Implementing the hybrid method then consists of the following steps for each
iteration, given the previous value :math:`\psi_{s-1}` where :math:`\psi_0`
represents specified initial values.

1. Apply the simulation smoother to retrieve a draw of the unobserved states,
   yielding :math:`\tilde \alpha = \psi_s^{(1)}`.
2. Draw a value for :math:`\phi = \psi_1^{(2)}`
   from its conditional posterior distribution, conditioning on the states
   drawn in step 1 and the parameters from the previous iteration.
3. Draw a value for :math:`\sigma^2 = \psi_s^{(3)}` from its conditional
   posterior distribution, conditioning on the state states drawn in step 1 and
   the autoregression coefficients drawn in step 2.
4. Propose a new value for :math:`\theta = \psi_s^{(4)}` using the random walk
   proposal,  and calculate the acceptance probability using the ``loglike`` function.

The implementation code is below, and the resultant histograms and traces from
10,000 iterations are given in :numref:`figure_5-gibbs-posteriors`.

Implementing Gibbs sampling: real business cycle model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, we can apply the same techniques as above to perform
Metropolis-within-Gibbs estimation of the real business cycle model parameters.
It is often difficult to estimate all of the parameters of the RBC model, or
indeed other structural models, with maximum likelihood. Above we only
estimated two of the six structural parameters. By choosing appropriately tight
priors it is often feasible to estimate more parameters; in this example we
estimate four of the six structural parameters: the discount rate, capital
share, and the two technology shock parameters. Of the two remaining
parameters, the disutility of labor only serves to pin down steady-state values
and so the model presented above is independent of its value (since it
considers data in in deviation-from-steady-state values), and the depreciation
rate is best calibrated when the observation datasets do not speak to
to depreciation (see for example :cite:`smets_shocks_2007`).

For the Metropolis-within-Gibbs simulation, we consider 8 blocks. The first
three blocks are sampled using Gibbs steps, and are very similar to the
ARMA(1,1) example; the first block samples the unobserved states, and the
second and third blocks sample the two technology shock parameters. Noticing
that the second row of the transition equation is simply an autoregression,
conditional on the states, we can use the same approach we did above. Thus the
priors on these parameters are the Gaussian and inverse-gamma conjugate priors
and the unobserved states are sampled using the simulation smoother.

The remaining blocks apply Metropolis steps to sample the remaining five
parameters: the discount rate, capital share, and the three measurement
variances. The priors on these parameters are as in :cite:`smets_shocks_2007`.
All priors are listed in :numref:`table-rbc-priors`, along with statistics
describing the posterior draws.

Again, the code is slightly too long to display inline, so it can be found in
the appendix. We perform 100,000 draws and burn the first 10,000. Of the
remaining 90,000 draws, each tenth draw is saved, so that the results below are
ultimately based on 9,000 draws. Histograms of the four estimated structural
parameters are presented in :numref:`figure_5-rbc-posteriors`.

.. _figure_5-rbc-posteriors:

.. figure:: images/fig_5-rbc-posteriors.png

   Output from Metropolis-within-Gibbs posterior simulation of the real business cycle.

As before, we may be interested in the implied impulse response functions and
the smoothed state values; here we calculate these be applying the Kalman
filter and smoother to the model based on the median parameter values.
:numref:`figure_5-gibbs-irf` displays the impulse responses and
:numref:`figure_5-gibbs-states` displays the smoothed states and confidence
intervals.

.. _figure_5-gibbs-irf:

.. figure:: images/fig_5-gibbs-irf.png

   Impulse response functions corresponding to Metropolis-within-Gibbs
   estimation of the real business cycle.

.. _figure_5-gibbs-states:

.. figure:: images/fig_5-gibbs-states.png

   Smoothed estimates of capital and the technology process from
   Metropolis-within-Gibbs estimation of the real business cycle.

.. [#] If the discount rate is denoted :math:`\beta`, then the Gamma prior
       actually applies to the transformation :math:`100 (\beta^{-1} - 1)`.
