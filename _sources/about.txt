About this documentation
========================

Much of the documentation style and boilerplate text has been copied from the
NumPy project.

Conventions
-----------

Names of classes, objects, constants, etc. are given in **boldface** font.
Often they are also links to a more detailed documentation of the
referred object.

This manual contains many examples of use, usually prefixed with the
Python prompt ``>>>`` (which is not a part of the example code). The
examples assume that you have first entered::

>>> import numpy as np
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import statsmodels.api as sm
>>> import dismalpy as dp

before running the examples.
